Displays a social menu using plain CSS.

== Description ==
Social Menu is an extremely lightweight plugin for creating menus using social media icons. It uses some clever CSS to find social media URLs in navigation menus and displays the brand icon for the link.

= Usage =
Currently there are no settings, just create a new menu called "Social" and add links to your social media profiles. The plugin will automatically detect these links and add the icons for you.

= Coming Soon =
Please note that this plugin is currently just the base CSS. It contains no settings yet. We will be adding a tonne of Customizer settings in the coming weeks to allow the appearance of social menus to be changed to your liking.
